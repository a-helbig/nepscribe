# NEPScribe

<!-- badges: start -->

NEPScribe is a Shiny application that generates dynamic Stata and R scripts to transform NEPS Scientific Use File (SUF) datasets into a person-year format—a data structure commonly required for many analytical tasks. This transformation can be challenging for new NEPS users because NEPS data combine lifecourse information stored in spell format with repeated cross-sectional data.

In addition, NEPScribe enables users to explore SUF datasets, including their variables and associated metadata. For this purpose, the app relies on the freely available semantic SUF files provided by NEPS. 

## Installation

``` r

## App Start

``` r
NEPScribe::run_app()
